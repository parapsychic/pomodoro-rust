# pomodoro-rust
To start, cd to the repo and do `cargo run`.

I have no idea how relative paths would work for this, so the bell sound is going to stay in the src for the time being and would only work if started from the root of the repo.

## Things I might get around to doing:
- Pause timer.
- Reset timer and start from beginning.
- Statistics.
- A better (colorful) progress bar.
